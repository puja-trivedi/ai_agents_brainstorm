       "'Drug addiction is a chronic, complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a loss of control of drug-taking behaviors. The current drug addiction and overdose epidemic in the United States has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic as people struggle with social isolation and economic distress (Cisneros and Cunningham, 2021). Much of the current addiction epidemic and surge in overdose deaths has been attributed to the use of opioids and, in particular, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. However, drug overdose deaths associated with psychostimulants rose 50  between 2019 and 2020 (Hedegaard et al., 2021). Furthermore, drug overdose deaths associated with cocaine have increased 3-fold since 1999 (Hedegaard et al., 2021;Ciccarone, 2021). While pharmacological treatments exist for opioid use disorder, no such treatments are available for stimulant use disorder. Thus, continued research on the molecular adaptations that occur following exposure to cocaine, and the cell types that may be susceptible to these adaptations, is important for development of future therapeutics.'"

      "  \"text\": \"Drug addiction is a chronic, complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a loss of control of drug-taking behaviors. The current drug addiction and overdose epidemic in the United States has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic as people struggle with social isolation and economic distress (Cisneros and Cunningham, 2021). Much of the current addiction epidemic and surge in overdose deaths has been attributed to the use of opioids and, in particular, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. However, drug overdose deaths associated with psychostimulants rose 50 between 2019 and 2020 (Hedegaard et al., 2021). Furthermore, drug overdose deaths associated with cocaine have increased 3-fold since 1999 (Hedegaard et al., 2021;Ciccarone, 2021). While pharmacological treatments exist for opioid use disorder, no such treatments are available for stimulant use disorder. Thus, continued research on the molecular adaptations that occur following exposure to cocaine, and the cell types that may be susceptible to these adaptations, is important for development of future therapeutics.\",\n",

To do this, I\\u2019ll search for occurrences of each entity, compute their start and end character positions in the text, and then output them as JSON objects with \\\"entity,\\\" \\\"label,\\\" \\\"start,\\\" and \\\"end.\\\" They want duplicates preserved. I'll work off the list of entities provided, but I\\u2019ll avoid any new labels unless they were explicitly mentioned. Let\\u2019s make sure the positions are accurate and get the right JSON format!\\n\\nTo handle this, I need to extract the entity names and their start and end indices from the provided text. I'll use the exact text string and manually define a list of entities. Using regular expressions with word boundaries will help in accurately finding all occurrences, including duplicates. I\\u2019ll define the labels too, and then compute the positions with code, ensuring the correct start and end indices for each entity. Let\\u2019s implement this using Python for accuracy!\\n**Task:**\\nFrom the annotated text with in\\u2011text annotations, produce a JSON object containing:\\n1. \\\"text\\\": raw text  \\n2. \\\"entities\\\": an array where each object has:\\n\\u2022 \\\"entity\\\": exact substring  \\n\\u2022 \\\"label\\\": the UPPERCASE category  \\n\\u2022 \\\"start\\\": start character index in the raw text  \\n\\u2022 \\\"end\\\": end character index in the raw text  \\n\\nYou can use the raw text to help cross reference the start and end indices.
