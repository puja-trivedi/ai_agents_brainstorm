    text: The current drug addiction and overdose epidemic in the United States has
      been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic as people struggle with social isolation
      and economic distress (Cisneros and Cunningham, 2021)
  - id: '1_1_3'
    text: Much of the current addiction epidemic and surge in overdose deaths has
      been attributed to the use of opioids and, in particular, synthetic opioids
      such as fentanyl

    text: Thus, continued research on the molecular adaptations that occur following
      exposure to cocaine, and the cell types that may be susceptible to these adaptations,
      is important for development of future therapeutics.

    text: The mesolimbic dopamine pathway is heavily implicated in molecular, cellular,
      and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse
  - id: '1_2_2'
    text: This pathway consists of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area
      (VTA) that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
  - id: '1_2_3'
    text: Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the NAc is important for adaptive behavior,
      as dopamine (DA) release tracks reward-predictive cues as a function of learning
      (Day et al., 2007)
  - id: '1_2_4'
    text: Exposure to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, increases extracellular concentrations
      of DA within the NAc
  - id: '1_2_5'
    text: Cocaine extends DA transmission by blocking the DA transporter present on
      VTA dopaminergic neurons, and this mechanism is required for behavioral and
      physiological responses to cocaine (Giros et al., 1996)
  - id: '1_2_6'
    text: Drug-induced elevations in DA promote transcriptional and epigenetic reorganization
      that ultimately gives rise to the cellular and behavioral adaptations that drive
      addiction-linked behaviors
  - id: '1_2_7'
    text: Within the NAc, DA engages the type-1 DA receptor (DRD1, encoded by the
      Drd1 gene) that is present on a subset of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), called
      D1-MSNs
  - id: '1_2_8'
    text: DRD1 activation stimulates signal transduction cascades that results in
      CREB phosphorylation and activation of immediate early gene (IEG) expression
      programs
  - id: '1_2_9'
    text: These IEG programs are comprised largely of activitydependent transcription
      factors such as Fos, FosB, and Nr4a1 (Savell et al., 2020;Nishi et al., 2011;Bertran-Gonzalez
      et al., 2008), each of which are critical mediators for cellular and behavioral
      adaptations to drugs of abuse (Zhang et al., 2006;Nestler et al., 2001;Carpenter
      et al., 2020).

    text: The NAc is a heterogeneous brain region consisting of many transcriptionally
      defined cell types
  - id: '1_3_2'
    text: While a significant amount of research has focused on the role of DA receptor-expressing
      MSNs in adaptations to drugs of abuse, recent reports have also demonstrated
      significant roles for other cell types
  - id: '1_3_3'
    text: For example, optogenetic inhibition of NAc somatostatin expressing interneurons
      (Sst-interneurons) attenuates cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (Ribeiro
      et al., 2018), suggesting that these cells are important for behavioral adaptations
      to drugs of abuse
  - id: '1_3_4'
    text: Similarly, photoinhibition of cholinergic interneurons (Chat-interneurons)
      also blocks cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (Witten et al., 2010)

    text: Interestingly, recent research has also demonstrated an important role for
      astrocytes in mediating cocaineinduced synaptic and behavioral adaptations (Wang
      et al., 2021;Corkrum et al., 2020)

    text: These results demonstrate that diverse cell types within the NAc contribute
      to the molecular, cellular, and behavioral effects of cocaine.
  - id: '1_4_1'
    text: Despite established cell type heterogeneity in the NAc, many studies rely
      on transgenic animal models that allow for the investigation of these changes
      only in individual cell populations
  - id: '1_4_2'
    text: Unlike many techniques focused on a defined class of cells, single nucleus
      RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution that allows for
      the investigation of thousands of genes in thousands of cells with a single
      assay
  - id: '1_4_3'
    text: This resolution not only permits detection of cocaine-induced transcriptional
      changes in many cell types, but also allows for better understanding of the
      molecular heterogeneity within the NAc
  - id: '1_4_4'
    text: Recently, snRNA-seq approaches have been used to generate cellular atlases
      of the mouse (Chen et al., 2021), non-human primate (He et al., 2021), and human
      (Tran et al., 2021) NAc
  - id: '1_4_5'
    text: However, snRNA-seq has only been used to define early gene expression changes
      to acute cocaine, while the transcriptional effects of repeated cocaine in various
      NAc cell types is less well studied
  - id: '1_4_6'
    text: Here, we used snRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile 39,254 nuclei from
      male and female Sprague-Dawley rats
  - id: '1_4_7'
    text: Rats were further subdivided by treatment (cocaine or saline) and exposure
      paradigm (acute or repeated)
  - id: '1_4_8'
    text: This study confirms both the presence of many previously defined cell types
      within the rat NAc, and reveals that D1-MSNs exhibit the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine across all cell populations
  - id: '1_4_9'
    text: Additionally, snRNA-seq of the rat NAc allowed for the investigation of
      cluster-specific expression of different neurotransmitter receptor systems and
      identified novel marker genes for two populations of transcriptionally distinct
      D1-MSNs.
  - id: '2_1_1'
    text: To begin understanding cell-type heterogeneity within the rat NAc, we first
      integrated 15,655 nuclei from a previously published dataset (Savell et al.,
      2020) consisting of male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats that received
      a single (acute) injection of cocaine with 23,599 nuclei from a new dataset
      following seven daily (repeated) injections of cocaine (Fig

  - id: '2_1_5'
    text: Following integration and dimensionality reduction, we identified 11 transcriptionally
      distinct neuronal populations and 5 glial populations that were not specific
      to a single dataset and did not differ by sex (Fig
  - id: '2_1_9'
    text: Furthermore, calculation of Local Inverse Simpsons Index (LISI) demonstrated
      that all clusters were well mixed, indicating successful integration (Supp
  - id: '2_1_12'
    text: A significant portion of neurons within the NAc are GABAergic MSNs that
      express high levels of Gad1, Ppp1r1b,Foxp2,and Bcl11b (Fig
  - id: '2_1_14'
    text: A large majority of MSNs can be further classified by the expression of
      Drd1, the gene encoding the type-1 dopamine receptor, or Drd2, the gene encoding
      the type-2 dopamine receptor (Fig
  - id: '2_1_16'
    text: While we have previously reported the presence of two transcriptionally
      distinct Drd2-expressing MSN populations (Drd2-MSN-1 and Drd2-MSN-2) (Savell
      et al., 2020), this analysis also identified two transcriptionally distinct
      Drd1-expressing MSN populations as well (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig
  - id: '2_1_18'
    text: In addition to Drd1-and Drd2-MSNs, this analysis also identified previously
      reported Drd3-and Grm8-expressing MSNs (Drd3-MSN and Grm8-MSN), which have also
      been identified within the striatum of non-human primates (He et al., 2021)
  - id: '2_1_19'
    text: While most of the GABAergic neurons in the NAc are MSNs, distinct populations
      of GABAergic interneurons are also known to play critical yet distinct roles
      in striatal function (Kawaguchi, 1993)
  - id: '2_1_20'
    text: While we have previously characterized parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons
      within the NAc (Savell et al., 2020), this analysis also identified a cholinergic
      interneuron population marked by the expression of Chat (Chat-Interneuron)
  - id: '2_1_21'
    text: Previous research has demonstrated that Chat-Interneurons are critical regulators
      of drug-induced behavioral adaptations (Witten et al., 2010), and this dataset
      now provides comprehensive transcriptional profiling of these cells within the
      rat NAc
  - id: '2_1_22'
    text: In addition to transcriptionally distinct neuronal populations, we also
      identified 5 glial clusters that are almost entirely devoid of Gad1 and Syt1
      mRNA, and expressed canonical markers of their respective populations (Fig
  - id: '2_1_24'
    text: For example, Astrocytes exhibit high expression of both Aqp4 and Gja1, while
      Oligodendrocytes exhibit high expression of Mbp, the gene encoding myelin basic
      protein (Fig
  - id: '3_1_1'
    text: The integration of over 39,000 nuclei from rats that underwent different
      cocaine exposure paradigms identified two populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs
      (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig
  - id: '3_1_2'
    text: 2a)
  - id: '3_1_3'
    text: To begin understanding the distinct gene expression signatures of these
      Drd1-MSN populations, we conducted a differential expression analysis using
      pseudobulked gene expression matrices
  - id: '3_1_4'
    text: This analysis identified 506 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 cluster and
      665 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 cluster
  - id: '3_1_5'
    text: Interestingly, Ebf1 is the most highly enriched differentially expressed
      gene in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '3_1_7'
    text: Ebf1 is a known marker of D1-MSNs and is implicated in MSN early development
      (Lobo et al., 2008)
  - id: '3_1_8'
    text: Calb1, the gene encoding the calcium binding protein Calbindin 1, is another
      gene that is enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '3_1_10'
    text: Calb1 is a spatial marker within the NAc and is highly enriched in the NAc
      core (Jongen-Rêlo et al., 1994)
  - id: '3_1_11'
    text: Included in the top 10 differentially expressed genes in the Drd1-MSN-2
      population was Htr4, the gene that codes for the serotonin receptor 4 (Fig
  - id: '3_1_13'
    text: HTR4 autoradiography suggests that this receptor is located in the ventral
      portion of the NAc shell (Jean et al., 2012)
  - id: '3_1_14'
    text: The differential enrichment of Htr4 and Calb1 suggests that the two populations
      of Drd1expressing MSNs identified by snRNA-seq are both transcriptionally and
      spatially distinct.
  - id: '3_2_1'
    text: Next, we set out to understand the specific gene networks and pathways that
      may be enriched in these two D1-MSN populations
  - id: '3_2_2'
    text: Molecular function pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of genes involved
      in calcium transport and signaling in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, but enrichment
      of genes involved in potassium transport in the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_4'
    text: For example, Trpc3, a gene encoding a calcium permeable channel, and Cacng3,
      a gene encoding an L-type calcium channel, are both highly enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_6'
    text: Conversely, several genes encoding potassium channels, such as Kcnc1, Kcnc2,
      and Kcng3, are enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 population, further highlighting the
      enrichment of genes involved in potassium transport in this population
  - id: '3_2_7'
    text: While these genes are differentially enriched, both calcium-and potassium-related
      genes are expressed to some extent in both clusters (Fig
  - id: '3_3_1'
    text: Functional investigation of transcriptionally distinct populations of neurons
      in the mammalian brain requires the use of cell type-specific promoters
  - id: '3_3_2'
    text: To facilitate the future investigation of the two populations of transcriptionally
      distinct Drd1-expressing MSNs, we next identified potential marker genes that
      are both differentially and highly expressed within a population
  - id: '3_3_3'
    text: This analysis identified Ebf1 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_3_4'
    text: 2e) and Htr4 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_3_6'
    text: An additional characteristic of marker genes is that they are expressed
      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster
  - id: '3_3_7'
    text: Plotting the expression of these genes on a UMAP shows differential enrichment
      of Ebf1 and Htr4 between the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Fig
  - id: '3_3_9'
    text: However, Ebf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells, while Htr4 is also
      expressed in Drd2and Drd3-MSNs
  - id: '3_3_10'
    text: Thus, these genes may act as marker genes in combination with Drd1 but cannot
      act as marker genes alone.
  - id: '4_1_1'
    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol
  - id: '4_1_2'
    text: To enable visualization of distinct puncta representing cells expressing
      a combination of Drd1, Htr4, and Ebf1, we performed multiplexed analysis with
      probe sets specific to each transcript (Fig
  - id: '4_1_3'
    text: 3a-c)
  - id: '4_1_4'
    text: Consistent with our computational analysis, we identify unique subpopulations
      of Drd1 cells that are either Ebf1 or Htr4, with significantly fewer cells that
      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig
  - id: '4_1_6'
    text: Furthermore, our in situ experiments revealed unique spatial distributions
      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig
  - id: '4_1_8'
    text: There was no significant spatial distribution difference in the proportion
      of Drd1 Ebf1Htr4 cells
  - id: '4_1_9'
    text: Overall, these results are consistent with snRNA-seq analysis, and confirm
      largely non-overlapping expression of Ebf1 and Htr4 within Drd1 cells (Fig
  - id: '5_1_1'
    text: We previously demonstrated that a single acute cocaine exposure differentially
      alters the transcriptome of molecularly defined cell types within the NAc (Savell
      et al., 2020)
  - id: '5_1_2'
    text: To begin understanding how repeated cocaine exposure alters the transcriptome
      of distinct NAc populations, we injected male and female Sprague-Dawley rats
      with 20 mgkg cocaine for 7 consecutive days (Fig
  - id: '5_1_3'
    text: 1a, Supp
  - id: '5_1_6'
    text: Before directly comparing acute and repeated exposures, we first investigated
      cell type-specific transcriptional responses to cocaine exposure, regardless
      of type or duration
  - id: '5_1_7'
    text: To do this, we collapsed both datasets and used a pseudobulk approach to
      identify cocaine-dependent, cell typespecific differentially expressed genes
      (DEGs; Supp
  - id: '5_1_8'
    text: Table 2)
  - id: '5_1_9'
    text: This approach increased the number of replicates used for statistical comparisons
      and circumvented previously identified issues with deprecated differential expression
      methods previously used for snRNA-seq (Squair et al., 2021)
  - id: '5_1_10'
    text: Strikingly, the Drd1-MSN-1 population exhibited the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine, with 236 total DEGs following cocaine experience (184 upregulated,
      52 downregulated; Fig
  - id: '5_1_11'
    text: 4a,b)
  - id: '5_1_12'
    text: These upregulated DEGs include immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Nr4a3,
      Tiparp, and Fosl2 (Fig
  - id: '5_1_14'
    text: Recent evidence has demonstrated that astrocytes within the NAc also play
      a key role in the neuronal and behavioral response to dopamine and drugs of
      abuse (Wang et al., 2021;Corkrum et al., 2020;Shelkar et al., 2022)
  - id: '5_1_15'
    text: Disruption of glutamatergic transport, release, and signaling is implicated
      in substance use disorders (Reissner and Kalivas, 2010;Kalivas, 2009), and astrocytes
      are heavily involved in the regulation of this process across the brain (Mahmoud
      et al., 2019)
  - id: '5_1_16'
    text: Interestingly, Gria1, an ionotropic AMPA receptor, is significantly decreased
      in Astrocytes following cocaine exposure (Fig
  - id: '5_1_18'
    text: Unlike the Drd1-MSN-1 population, Astrocytes exhibited more genes with cocaine-dependent
      decreases in expression (Fig
  - id: '5_1_20'
    text: While most DEGs in the Astrocyte population are downregulated with cocaine,
      Pde10a, the gene encoding the cAMPregulated phosphodiesterase 10A, is upregulated
      by cocaine in both the Astrocyte and Sst-Interneuron cluster (Fig
  - id: '5_2_1'
    text: Previous research has demonstrated that Drd1-expressing MSNs exhibit robust
      transcriptional changes in response to cocaine (Savell et al., 2020;Bertran-Gonzalez
      et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2005)
  - id: '5_2_2'
    text: More specifically, snRNA-seq from the rat NAc following acute cocaine exposure
      demonstrated that D1-MSNs have the most robust transcriptional response to cocaine
      when compared to other transcriptionally distinct NAc cell types (Savell et
      al., 2020)
  - id: '5_2_3'
    text: In this dataset, only one of the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Drd1-MSN-1)
      had a robust transcriptional response to cocaine
  - id: '5_2_4'
    text: For example, Nr4a3, Fosb, Fosl2, and Tiparp are all significantly increased
      following cocaine exposure only in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '5_3_1'
    text: Next, we set out to investigate the relationship of cocaine dependent DEGs
      across cocaine exposure paradigms
  - id: '5_3_2'
    text: To do this, we first conducted DEG analyses comparing cocaine and saline
      samples with exposure type ignored (i.e., all cocaine samples vs all saline
      samples), acute exposure only, and repeated exposure samples only
  - id: '5_3_3'
    text: The log2 (Fold Change) values for all DEGs were then concatenated and subject
      to hierarchical clustering
  - id: '5_3_4'
    text: Overall, this analysis identified that many of the genes altered by acute
      cocaine are also altered by repeated cocaine in the same direction (Fig
  - id: '5_3_6'
    text: However, for the Drd1-MSN-1 population some genes altered by acute cocaine
      are not altered by repeated cocaine
  - id: '5_3_7'
    text: Furthermore, while the overall pattern shows concordant gene expression
      patterns, some cocaine-regulated genes within the Astrocyte cluster demonstrate
      opposite changes with an acute or repeated exposure
  - id: '5_3_8'
    text: To estimate the degree of concordance between gene expression programs altered
      by acute and repeated cocaine exposure in a thresholdfree manner, we next used
      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)
  - id: '5_3_9'
    text: To complete this analysis, we ranked gene lists by the log2 (Fold Change),
      which was calculated by dividing the log-normalized expression values of cocaine
      cells by the log-normalized expression values of saline cells
  - id: '5_3_10'
    text: This analysis identified that, on a cell type-specific basis, acute and
      repeated cocaine gene expression signatures are primarily concordant
  - id: '5_3_11'
    text: For example, the acute and repeated cocaine changes for the Drd1-MSN-1,
      Astrocyte, and Sst-Interneuron populations are significantly concordant for
      both upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig
  - id: '5_3_13'
    text: However, the strength of this overlap and concordance is substantially different
      for these populations.

    text: Recently, transcriptional atlases of the non-human primate (NHP) striatum
      (He et al., 2021) and human NAc (Tran et al., 2021) have demonstrated similar
      gene expression profiles of specific marker genes that we identify within the
      rat NAc
  - id: '6_1_2'
    text: To quantify this overlap and perform cross-species comparisons, we focused
      on conservation of MSNs given that both NHP and human datasets identified and
      validated the presence of several transcriptionally distinct MSN subtypes
  - id: '6_1_3'
    text: Direct comparison of our rat snRNA-seq dataset to monkey or human datasets
      revealed potential conservation of many NHP and human cell types (Fig
  - id: '6_1_4'
    text: 5a-c)
  - id: '6_1_5'
    text: For example, the rat Drd1-MSN-1 population is correlated with the human
      D1.MSN_A and NHP D1.Matrix populations, and the rat Drd2-MSN-1 population is
      correlated with the human D2.MSN_A and the NHP D2

    text: Transcriptionally conserved cell types should exhibit similar expression
      and enrichment of marker genes
  - id: '6_2_2'
    text: For example, Drd2-MSNs are classically characterized by the enrichment of
      Drd2 and Penk, while Drd1-MSNs are characterized by the enrichment of Drd1 and
      Ebf1
  - id: '6_2_3'
    text: Across species, transcriptionally distinct populations of Drd2-MSNs are
      similarly enriched for Drd2, but differ in their enrichment of Penk (Fig
  - id: '6_2_6'
    text: 4a-c)
  - id: '6_2_7'
    text: A similar pattern is observed in Drd1-MSNs across species, as Drd1 is highly
      enriched in Drd1-MSNs, but Ebf1 enrichment differs (Fig
  - id: '6_2_10'
    text: 4a-c)
  - id: '6_2_11'
    text: While the differential expression of Htr4 or Ebf1 distinguishes Drd1-MSNs
      in the rat NAc, this pattern is not observed in higher order mammals as Htr4
      is ubiquitously expressed across cell types (Supp
  - id: '6_2_13'
    text: 4a-c)
  - id: '6_2_14'
    text: Furthermore, Htr4 is enriched in the MSN.D1_A human population (Fig
  - id: '6_2_15'
    text: 5c) along with Ebf1
  - id: '6_2_16'
    text: Thus, Htr4 and Ebf1 may not be suitable markers for distinguishing between
      transcriptionally distinct populations of Drd1-MSNs in higher order mammals.

    text: snRNA-seq provides the unique opportunity to study both the cell type-specific
      transcriptional responses to drugs of abuse, as well as the cell-type heterogeneity
      that exists within the NAc
  - id: '7_2_4'
    text: In the present study, we report the integration of a previously published
      NAc snRNA-seq dataset collected following acute cocaine exposure (Savell et
      al., 2020) with a new dataset collected following repeated cocaine exposure
  - id: '7_2_5'
    text: The resulting dataset contains 39,254 nuclei across 16 transcriptionally
      distinct populations (11 neuronal and 5 non-neuronal), which more than doubles
      the size of our previously published work
  - id: '7_2_6'
    text: The addition of both biological and technical replicates, along with the
      addition of over 24,000 nuclei, allowed us to generate a comprehensive transcriptional
      atlas of the rat NAc and investigate cell type-specific transcriptional responses
      to cocaine.

    text: We were also interested in understanding the distribution of expression
      of genes encoding different receptor systems, which provides additional information
      regarding which cell types may respond to diverse classes of drugs
  - id: '7_3_2'
    text: For example, there is significant renewed interest in the action of psychedelic
      drugs, many of which act on serotonin receptors
  - id: '7_3_3'
    text: Htr2a, the gene encoding serotonin receptor type 2A and the expected target
      of many psychedelics, is expressed in a small proportion of Drd1-and Drd2-expressing
      MSNs, as well as Sst-interneurons (Supp

  - id: '7_3_6'
    text: Thus, these populations of cells will most likely respond to classic psychedelics
  - id: '7_3_7'
    text: There is also considerable interest in the distribution of expression of
      opioid receptors in the NAc as opioid-associated overdose deaths continue to
      increase (Hedegaard et al., 2021;Ciccarone, 2021)
  - id: '7_3_8'
    text: Previous research has demonstrated that 25  of cells containing the delta
      opioid receptor (Oprd1) in the NAc also contained Met 5 -Enkaphalin (Svingos
      et al., 1998), a peptide encoded by the gene Penk
  - id: '7_3_9'
    text: Penk is a marker gene for Drd2-expressing MSNs, suggesting that the delta
      opioid receptor is expressed in this population of neurons

    text: Our data confirms this observation, as Oprd1 is highly expressed in the
      Drd2-MSN-1 population (Supp

    text: A major focus of this study was to characterize cell type-specific gene
      programs induced by cocaine experience
  - id: '7_4_2'
    text: Prior work has revealed distinct differences in transcriptomic changes between
      volitional cocaine paradigms, such has self-administration, and experimenteradministered
      injections
  - id: '7_4_3'
    text: For example, after a prolonged withdrawal period, animals that underwent
      cocaine self-administration exhibit increased surface expression of calcium
      permeable AMPA receptors, while animals that underwent experimenter-administered
      injections do not (McCutcheon et al., 2011)
  - id: '7_4_4'
    text: Additionally, a recent study systematically tested transcriptomic changes
      occurring in the VTA across several cocaine paradigms and identified several
      IEGs that are upregulated by experimenter-administered cocaine injections (Campbell
      et al., 2021)
  - id: '7_4_5'
    text: Like this study, we also identified several IEGs (Fosl2, Tiparp, Fosb),
      that are upregulated by experimenter-administered cocaine injections
  - id: '7_4_6'
    text: Notably, we did not observe significant locomotor sensitization to repeated
      doses of cocaine in the present study (Supp
  - id: '7_4_9'
    text: While sensitization is commonly (but not always (Gulley et al., 2003;Mayfield
      et al., 1992;Cass et al., 1993)) observed with repeated cocaine injections,
      it is possible that distinct gene expression patterns may be observed in animals
      that exhibit sensitized responses to cocaine as compared to those that do not
  - id: '7_4_10'
    text: This will be an interesting consideration for future studies that are able
      to obtain single-nuclei transcriptional profiles while preserving individual
      animal variability in the data structure
  - id: '7_4_11'
    text: Ultimately, the results presented in the current study shed light on cocaine-induced,
      cell-type specific transcriptomic changes occurring in the NAc, expanding our
      understanding of how drug experience shapes the brain
  - id: '7_4_12'
    text: Further research investigating paradigmspecific transcriptional changes
      may identify molecular correlates of more complex behaviors, such as cocaine
      seeking or craving.

    text: The largest transcriptional response to cocaine experience occurred in the
      Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '7_5_2'
    text: 4a,b)
  - id: '7_5_3'
    text: These changes included IEGs such as Fosl2
  - id: '7_5_4'
    text: IEGs and other cocaine-regulated genes in the Drd1-MSN-1 population are
      induced by both acute and repeated cocaine, but to a lesser extent with repeated
      cocaine
  - id: '7_5_5'
    text: This data is in agreement with previous research that demonstrated induction
      of FOSB protein by repeated cocaine was weaker as compared to acute cocaine
      (Zhang et al., 2005)
  - id: '7_5_6'
    text: The second population of Drd1-expressing MSNs within the NAc, Drd1-MSN-2,
      did not have a robust transcriptional response to cocaine experience
  - id: '7_5_7'
    text: A multitude of previous research has demonstrated that Drd1-expressing cells
      within the NAc exhibit transcriptional and epigenetic responses to drugs of
      abuse (Savell et al., 2020;Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2006;Zhang
      et al., 2005;Zipperly et al., 2021)
  - id: '7_5_8'
    text: Thus, the identification of a population of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the
      NAc with a significantly attenuated transcriptional response to cocaine is intriguing
      because it highlights a previously underappreciated level of molecular heterogeneity
      within this population of cells
  - id: '7_5_9'
    text: Notably, further analysis of population-specific DEGs also revealed an enrichment
      of calcium transport-related terms for Drd1-MSN-1 and potassium transport-related
      terms for Drd1-MSN-2
  - id: '7_5_10'
    text: The differential enrichment for calcium-related terms and genes may explain
      the transcriptional response to cocaine in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, as many
      IEGs rely on calcium-dependent signaling cascades for induction.
  - id: '7_6_1'
    text: Our dataset also provided the opportunity to identify marker genes for these
      two populations
  - id: '7_6_2'
    text: We identified Ebf1 as a marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-1 population and Htr4
      as a marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-2 population
  - id: '7_6_3'
    text: In situ experiments validated the presence of two distinct populations of
      Drd1-expressing MSNs based on the presence of Htr4 and Ebf1
  - id: '7_6_4'
    text: These in situ experiments also revealed a spatial separation of these MSNs,
      as Drd1Ebf1 cells were primarily found in the NAc core and Drd1Htr4 cells were
      primarily found in the NAc shell
  - id: '7_6_5'
    text: Transcriptional similarity based on spatial location may also explain why
      the Drd1-MSN-1 population is more closely related to the Drd2-MSN-1 population
      than the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Supp
  - id: '7_6_7'
    text: 4a)
  - id: '7_6_8'
    text: In fact, analysis of the relationship between cell types within the NHP
      identifies that Drd1-and Drd2-expressing MSNs from the same striatal subregions
      are more closely related than Drd1-expressing MSNs found in distinct striatal
      compartments (Supp
  - id: '7_6_11'
    text: Similarly, the MSN.D1_A and MSN.D2_A human populations are more closely
      related to each other than other Drd1-or Drd2-expressing MSNs, although no spatial
      information is available in that dataset (Supp
  - id: '7_6_14'
    text: Together, these results suggest that at least some component of transcriptional
      diversity in the NAc reflects the spatial organization of this structure.

    text: Although sex differences in drug-induced behavioral adaptations have long
      been appreciated (Hu et al., 2004;Bobzean et al., 2014;Becker and Chartoff,
      2019;Evans, 2007), more recent research has also demonstrated sex-specific drug-induced
      molecular adaptations (López et al., 2021)
  - id: '7_7_2'
    text: Our dataset includes nuclei from both male and female rats, and thus we
      examined sex-specific transcriptional responses to cocaine across cell populations
      within the NAc, again using the collapsed acute and repeated dataset to enable
      pseudobulk treatment comparisons between male and females
  - id: '7_7_3'
    text: In general, the direction of cocaine-induced mRNA changes was largely concordant
      between males and females across most cell populations (Supp

    text: Consistent with the sex-combined identification of cocaine DEGs, immediate
      early gene Nr4a3, transcription elongation factor Ell2, and cytoskeletal regulator
      Elmo2 were all significantly elevated in the Drd1-MSN-1 population in both sexes

      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig

      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig

      samples with exposure type ignored (i.e., all cocaine samples vs all saline
      samples), acute exposure only, and repeated exposure samples only

    text: The log2 (Fold Change) values for all DEGs were then concatenated and subject
      to hierarchical clustering

      cocaine are also altered by repeated cocaine in the same direction (Fig

      patterns, some cocaine-regulated genes within the Astrocyte cluster demonstrate
      opposite changes with an acute or repeated exposure

    text: To estimate the degree of concordance between gene expression programs altered
      by acute and repeated cocaine exposure in a thresholdfree manner, we next used
      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)

      Astrocyte, and Sst-Interneuron populations are significantly concordant for
      both upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig

    text: Recently, transcriptional atlases of the non-human primate (NHP) striatum
      (He et al., 2021) and human NAc (Tran et al., 2021) have demonstrated similar
      gene expression profiles of specific marker genes that we identify within the
      rat NAc

    text: To quantify this overlap and perform cross-species comparisons, we focused
      on conservation of MSNs given that both NHP and human datasets identified and
      validated the presence of several transcriptionally distinct MSN subtypes

      D1.MSN_A and NHP D1.Matrix populations, and the rat Drd2-MSN-1 population is
      correlated with the human D2.MSN_A and the NHP D2

      and enrichment of marker genes

      Drd2 and Penk, while Drd1-MSNs are characterized by the enrichment of Drd1 and
      Ebf1
  - id: '6_2_3'
    text: Across species, transcriptionally distinct populations of Drd2-MSNs are
      similarly enriched for Drd2, but differ in their enrichment of Penk (Fig

    text: Furthermore, Htr4 is enriched in the MSN.D1_A human population (Fig

    text: Thus, the identification of a population of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the
      NAc with a significantly attenuated transcriptional response to cocaine is intriguing
      because it highlights a previously underappreciated level of molecular heterogeneity
      within this population of cells

    text: The differential enrichment for calcium-related terms and genes may explain
      the transcriptional response to cocaine in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, as many
      IEGs rely on calcium-dependent signaling cascades for induction.

    text: Additionally, snRNA-seq of the rat NAc allowed for the investigation of
      cluster-specific expression of different neurotransmitter receptor systems and
      identified novel marker genes for two populations of transcriptionally distinct
      D1-MSNs.

    text: To begin understanding cell-type heterogeneity within the rat NAc, we first
      integrated 15,655 nuclei from a previously published dataset (Savell et al.,

      express high levels of Gad1, Ppp1r1b,Foxp2,and Bcl11b (Fig
  - id: '2_1_14'
    text: A large majority of MSNs can be further classified by the expression of
      Drd1, the gene encoding the type-1 dopamine receptor, or Drd2, the gene encoding
      the type-2 dopamine receptor (Fig

    text: While we have previously reported the presence of two transcriptionally
      distinct Drd2-expressing MSN populations (Drd2-MSN-1 and Drd2-MSN-2) (Savell
      et al., 2020), this analysis also identified two transcriptionally distinct
      Drd1-expressing MSN populations as well (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig

    text: In addition to Drd1-and Drd2-MSNs, this analysis also identified previously
      reported Drd3-and Grm8-expressing MSNs (Drd3-MSN and Grm8-MSN), which have also
      been identified within the striatum of non-human primates (He et al., 2021)

    text: While most of the GABAergic neurons in the NAc are MSNs, distinct populations
      of GABAergic interneurons are also known to play critical yet distinct roles

    text: While we have previously characterized parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons
      within the NAc (Savell et al., 2020), this analysis also identified a cholinergic
      interneuron population marked by the expression of Chat (Chat-Interneuron)

    text: Previous research has demonstrated that Chat-Interneurons are critical regulators
      of drug-induced behavioral adaptations (Witten et al., 2010), and this dataset

      rat NAc

      665 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 cluster

      gene in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig

      gene that is enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig

      population was Htr4, the gene that codes for the serotonin receptor 4 (Fig

      portion of the NAc shell (Jean et al., 2012)

      of Drd1expressing MSNs identified by snRNA-seq are both transcriptionally and
      spatially distinct.

    text: Molecular function pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of genes involved
      in calcium transport and signaling in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, but enrichment
      of genes involved in potassium transport in the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig

  - id: '3_2_4'
    text: For example, Trpc3, a gene encoding a calcium permeable channel, and Cacng3,
      a gene encoding an L-type calcium channel, are both highly enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_6'
    text: Conversely, several genes encoding potassium channels, such as Kcnc1, Kcnc2,
      and Kcng3, are enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 population, further highlighting the
      enrichment of genes involved in potassium transport in this population

      distinct Drd1-expressing MSNs, we next identified potential marker genes that
      are both differentially and highly expressed within a population

    text: An additional characteristic of marker genes is that they are expressed
      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster

      of Ebf1 and Htr4 between the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Fig

    text: However, Ebf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells, while Htr4 is also
      expressed in Drd2and Drd3-MSNs

      act as marker genes alone.

    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol

      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig

    text: Furthermore, our in situ experiments revealed unique spatial distributions
      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig

    text: There was no significant spatial distribution difference in the proportion
      of Drd1 Ebf1Htr4 cells

      of genes involved in potassium transport in the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig

    text: This analysis identified Ebf1 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig

      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster

    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol

    text: Consistent with our computational analysis, we identify unique subpopulations
      of Drd1 cells that are either Ebf1 or Htr4, with significantly fewer cells that
      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig

    text: Furthermore, our in situ experiments revealed unique spatial distributions
      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4

    text: Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the NAc is important for adaptive behavior,
      as dopamine (DA) release tracks reward-predictive cues as a function of learning
      (Day et al., 2007)

    text: However, the strength of this overlap and concordance is substantially different
      for these populations.
  - id: '6_1_2'
    text: To quantify this overlap and perform cross-species comparisons, we focused
      on conservation of MSNs given that both NHP and human datasets identified and
      validated the presence of several transcriptionally distinct MSN subtypes
  - id: '6_1_5'
    text: For example, the rat Drd1-MSN-1 population is correlated with the human
      D1.MSN_A and NHP D1.Matrix populations, and the rat Drd2-MSN-1 population is
      correlated with the human D2.MSN_A and the NHP D2
  - id: '6_2_2'
    text: For example, Drd2-MSNs are classically characterized by the enrichment of
      Drd2 and Penk, while Drd1-MSNs are characterized by the enrichment of Drd1 and
      Ebf1
  - id: '6_2_3'

    text: Penk is a marker gene for Drd2-expressing MSNs, suggesting that the delta
      opioid receptor is expressed in this population of neurons
  - id: '7_4_3'
    text: For example, after a prolonged withdrawal period, animals that underwent
      cocaine self-administration exhibit increased surface expression of calcium
      permeable AMPA receptors, while animals that underwent experimenter-administered
      injections do not (McCutcheon et al., 2011)

    text: Notably, further analysis of population-specific DEGs also revealed an enrichment
      of calcium transport-related terms for Drd1-MSN-1 and potassium transport-related
      terms for Drd1-MSN-2
  - id: '7_5_10'
    text: The differential enrichment for calcium-related terms and genes may explain
      the transcriptional response to cocaine in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, as many
      IEGs rely on calcium-dependent signaling cascades for induction.

      significant roles for other cell types

    text: For example, optogenetic inhibition of NAc somatostatin expressing interneurons
      (Sst-interneurons) attenuates cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (Ribeiro

      on transgenic animal models that allow for the investigation of these changes
      only in individual cell populations

    text: Unlike many techniques focused on a defined class of cells, single nucleus
      RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution that allows for
      the investigation of thousands of genes in thousands of cells with a single

      within the rat NAc, and reveals that D1-MSNs exhibit the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine across all cell populations
  - id: '1_4_9'
    text: Additionally, snRNA-seq of the rat NAc allowed for the investigation of
      cluster-specific expression of different neurotransmitter receptor systems and
      identified novel marker genes for two populations of transcriptionally distinct
      D1-MSNs.

    text: To begin understanding cell-type heterogeneity within the rat NAc, we first
      integrated 15,655 nuclei from a previously published dataset (Savell et al.,
      2020) consisting of male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats that received
      a single (acute) injection of cocaine with 23,599 nuclei from a new dataset
      following seven daily (repeated) injections of cocaine (Fig

      distinct neuronal populations and 5 glial populations that were not specific
      to a single dataset and did not differ by sex (Fig

    text: A significant portion of neurons within the NAc are GABAergic MSNs that
      express high levels of Gad1, Ppp1r1b,Foxp2,and Bcl11b (Fig
  - id: '2_1_14'
    text: A large majority of MSNs can be further classified by the expression of
      Drd1, the gene encoding the type-1 dopamine receptor, or Drd2, the gene encoding
      the type-2 dopamine receptor (Fig
  - id: '2_1_16'
    text: While we have previously reported the presence of two transcriptionally
      distinct Drd2-expressing MSN populations (Drd2-MSN-1 and Drd2-MSN-2) (Savell
      et al., 2020), this analysis also identified two transcriptionally distinct
      Drd1-expressing MSN populations as well (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig

    text: In addition to Drd1-and Drd2-MSNs, this analysis also identified previously
      reported Drd3-and Grm8-expressing MSNs (Drd3-MSN and Grm8-MSN), which have also
      been identified within the striatum of non-human primates (He et al., 2021)

    text: While most of the GABAergic neurons in the NAc are MSNs, distinct populations
      of GABAergic interneurons are also known to play critical yet distinct roles
      in striatal function (Kawaguchi, 1993)
  - id: '2_1_20'
    text: While we have previously characterized parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons
      within the NAc (Savell et al., 2020), this analysis also identified a cholinergic
      interneuron population marked by the expression of Chat (Chat-Interneuron)

    text: Previous research has demonstrated that Chat-Interneurons are critical regulators
      of drug-induced behavioral adaptations (Witten et al., 2010), and this dataset
      now provides comprehensive transcriptional profiling of these cells within the
      rat NAc

    text: In addition to transcriptionally distinct neuronal populations, we also
      identified 5 glial clusters that are almost entirely devoid of Gad1 and Syt1
      mRNA, and expressed canonical markers of their respective populations (Fig

  - id: '3_1_3'
    text: To begin understanding the distinct gene expression signatures of these
      Drd1-MSN populations, we conducted a differential expression analysis using
      pseudobulked gene expression matrices

    text: This analysis identified 506 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 cluster and
      665 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 cluster

    text: Interestingly, Ebf1 is the most highly enriched differentially expressed
      gene in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig

      (Lobo et al., 2008)

    text: Calb1, the gene encoding the calcium binding protein Calbindin 1, is another
      gene that is enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '3_1_10'
    text: Calb1 is a spatial marker within the NAc and is highly enriched in the NAc
      core (Jongen-Rêlo et al., 1994)

    text: Included in the top 10 differentially expressed genes in the Drd1-MSN-2
      population was Htr4, the gene that codes for the serotonin receptor 4 (Fig

    text: HTR4 autoradiography suggests that this receptor is located in the ventral
      portion of the NAc shell (Jean et al., 2012)
  - id: '3_1_14'
    text: The differential enrichment of Htr4 and Calb1 suggests that the two populations
      of Drd1expressing MSNs identified by snRNA-seq are both transcriptionally and
      spatially distinct.

    text: Next, we set out to understand the specific gene networks and pathways that
      may be enriched in these two D1-MSN populations
  - id: '3_2_2'
    text: Molecular function pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of genes involved
      in calcium transport and signaling in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, but enrichment
      of genes involved in potassium transport in the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_4'
    text: For example, Trpc3, a gene encoding a calcium permeable channel, and Cacng3,
      a gene encoding an L-type calcium channel, are both highly enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_6'
    text: Conversely, several genes encoding potassium channels, such as Kcnc1, Kcnc2,
      and Kcng3, are enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 population, further highlighting the
      enrichment of genes involved in potassium transport in this population

    text: While these genes are differentially enriched, both calcium-and potassium-related
      genes are expressed to some extent in both clusters (Fig

    text: To facilitate the future investigation of the two populations of transcriptionally
      distinct Drd1-expressing MSNs, we next identified potential marker genes that
      are both differentially and highly expressed within a population
  - id: '3_3_6'
    text: An additional characteristic of marker genes is that they are expressed
      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster
  - id: '3_3_7'
    text: Plotting the expression of these genes on a UMAP shows differential enrichment
      of Ebf1 and Htr4 between the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Fig
  - id: '3_3_9'
    text: However, Ebf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells, while Htr4 is also
      expressed in Drd2and Drd3-MSNs

    text: Thus, these genes may act as marker genes in combination with Drd1 but cannot
      act as marker genes alone.
  - id: '4_1_1'
    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol
  - id: '4_1_2'
    text: To enable visualization of distinct puncta representing cells expressing
      a combination of Drd1, Htr4, and Ebf1, we performed multiplexed analysis with
      probe sets specific to each transcript (Fig
  - id: '4_1_6'
    text: Furthermore, our in situ experiments revealed unique spatial distributions
      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig

    text: There was no significant spatial distribution difference in the proportion
      of Drd1 Ebf1Htr4 cells

      largely non-overlapping expression of Ebf1 and Htr4 within Drd1 cells (Fig

      alters the transcriptome of molecularly defined cell types within the NAc (Savell

      cell type-specific transcriptional responses to cocaine exposure, regardless
      of type or duration

      methods previously used for snRNA-seq (Squair et al., 2021)

    text: Strikingly, the Drd1-MSN-1 population exhibited the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine, with 236 total DEGs following cocaine experience (184 upregulated,

    text: Interestingly, Gria1, an ionotropic AMPA receptor, is significantly decreased
      in Astrocytes following cocaine exposure (Fig

    text: While most DEGs in the Astrocyte population are downregulated with cocaine,
      Pde10a, the gene encoding the cAMPregulated phosphodiesterase 10A, is upregulated
      by cocaine in both the Astrocyte and Sst-Interneuron cluster (Fig

    text: More specifically, snRNA-seq from the rat NAc following acute cocaine exposure
      demonstrated that D1-MSNs have the most robust transcriptional response to cocaine
      when compared to other transcriptionally distinct NAc cell types (Savell et
      al., 2020)

      had a robust transcriptional response to cocaine

      following cocaine exposure only in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig

    text: Next, we set out to investigate the relationship of cocaine dependent DEGs
      across cocaine exposure paradigms

      samples with exposure type ignored (i.e., all cocaine samples vs all saline
      samples), acute exposure only, and repeated exposure samples only

    text: The log2 (Fold Change) values for all DEGs were then concatenated and subject
      to hierarchical clustering

      cocaine are also altered by repeated cocaine in the same direction (Fig

    text: However, for the Drd1-MSN-1 population some genes altered by acute cocaine
      are not altered by repeated cocaine

      patterns, some cocaine-regulated genes within the Astrocyte cluster demonstrate
      opposite changes with an acute or repeated exposure

      by acute and repeated cocaine exposure in a thresholdfree manner, we next used
      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)

    text: To complete this analysis, we ranked gene lists by the log2 (Fold Change),
      which was calculated by dividing the log-normalized expression values of cocaine
      cells by the log-normalized expression values of saline cells

    text: This analysis identified that, on a cell type-specific basis, acute and
      repeated cocaine gene expression signatures are primarily concordant
  - id: '5_3_11'
    text: For example, the acute and repeated cocaine changes for the Drd1-MSN-1,
      Astrocyte, and Sst-Interneuron populations are significantly concordant for
      both upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig

    text: While the differential expression of Htr4 or Ebf1 distinguishes Drd1-MSNs
      in the rat NAc, this pattern is not observed in higher order mammals as Htr4
      is ubiquitously expressed across cell types (Supp

      distinct Drd2-expressing MSN populations (Drd2-MSN-1 and Drd2-MSN-2) (Savell

      population was Htr4, the gene that codes for the serotonin receptor 4 (Fig

      portion of the NAc shell (Jean et al., 2012)

    text: An additional characteristic of marker genes is that they are expressed
      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster

      of Ebf1 and Htr4 between the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Fig

    text: Thus, these genes may act as marker genes in combination with Drd1 but cannot
      act as marker genes alone.

    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol

      a combination of Drd1, Htr4, and Ebf1, we performed multiplexed analysis with
      probe sets specific to each transcript (Fig

    text: Consistent with our computational analysis, we identify unique subpopulations
      of Drd1 cells that are either Ebf1 or Htr4, with significantly fewer cells that
      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig

      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig

    text: There was no significant spatial distribution difference in the proportion
      of Drd1 Ebf1Htr4 cells

      cell type-specific transcriptional responses to cocaine exposure, regardless
      of type or duration

    text: While most DEGs in the Astrocyte population are downregulated with cocaine,
      Pde10a, the gene encoding the cAMPregulated phosphodiesterase 10A, is upregulated
      by cocaine in both the Astrocyte and Sst-Interneuron cluster (Fig

      had a robust transcriptional response to cocaine

    text: Next, we set out to investigate the relationship of cocaine dependent DEGs
      across cocaine exposure paradigms

      samples with exposure type ignored (i.e., all cocaine samples vs all saline
      samples), acute exposure only, and repeated exposure samples only

    text: The log2 (Fold Change) values for all DEGs were then concatenated and subject
      to hierarchical clustering

      cocaine are also altered by repeated cocaine in the same direction (Fig

      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)

      which was calculated by dividing the log-normalized expression values of cocaine
      cells by the log-normalized expression values of saline cells

      repeated cocaine gene expression signatures are primarily concordant

      Astrocyte, and Sst-Interneuron populations are significantly concordant for
      both upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig

      similarly enriched for Drd2, but differ in their enrichment of Penk (Fig

    text: While the differential expression of Htr4 or Ebf1 distinguishes Drd1-MSNs
      in the rat NAc, this pattern is not observed in higher order mammals as Htr4
      is ubiquitously expressed across cell types (Supp

      patterns, some cocaine-regulated genes within the Astrocyte cluster demonstrate
      opposite changes with an acute or repeated exposure

    text: To estimate the degree of concordance between gene expression programs altered
      by acute and repeated cocaine exposure in a thresholdfree manner, we next used
      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)

    text: To complete this analysis, we ranked gene lists by the log2 (Fold Change),
      which was calculated by dividing the log-normalized expression values of cocaine
      cells by the log-normalized expression values of saline cells

    text: This analysis identified that, on a cell type-specific basis, acute and
      repeated cocaine gene expression signatures are primarily concordant

      Astrocyte, and Sst-Interneuron populations are significantly concordant for
      both upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig

    text: However, the strength of this overlap and concordance is substantially different
      for these populations.

    text: To quantify this overlap and perform cross-species comparisons, we focused
      on conservation of MSNs given that both NHP and human datasets identified and
      validated the presence of several transcriptionally distinct MSN subtypes

      D1.MSN_A and NHP D1.Matrix populations, and the rat Drd2-MSN-1 population is
      correlated with the human D2.MSN_A and the NHP D2

    text: For example, Drd2-MSNs are classically characterized by the enrichment of
      Drd2 and Penk, while Drd1-MSNs are characterized by the enrichment of Drd1 and
      Ebf1

    text: Across species, transcriptionally distinct populations of Drd2-MSNs are
      similarly enriched for Drd2, but differ in their enrichment of Penk (Fig

    text: While the differential expression of Htr4 or Ebf1 distinguishes Drd1-MSNs
      in the rat NAc, this pattern is not observed in higher order mammals as Htr4
      is ubiquitously expressed across cell types (Supp

    text: While a significant amount of research has focused on the role of DA receptor-expressing
      MSNs in adaptations to drugs of abuse, recent reports have also demonstrated
      significant roles for other cell types
  - id: '1_3_3'
    text: For example, optogenetic inhibition of NAc somatostatin expressing interneurons
      (Sst-interneurons) attenuates cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (Ribeiro
      et al., 2018), suggesting that these cells are important for behavioral adaptations
      to drugs of abuse

      also blocks cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (Witten et al., 2010)

      astrocytes in mediating cocaineinduced synaptic and behavioral adaptations (Wang

      on transgenic animal models that allow for the investigation of these changes
      only in individual cell populations

    text: Unlike many techniques focused on a defined class of cells, single nucleus
      RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution that allows for
      the investigation of thousands of genes in thousands of cells with a single
      assay
  - id: '1_4_3'
    text: This resolution not only permits detection of cocaine-induced transcriptional
      changes in many cell types, but also allows for better understanding of the

      to acute cocaine, while the transcriptional effects of repeated cocaine in various
      NAc cell types is less well studied

    text: Here, we used snRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile 39,254 nuclei from
      male and female Sprague-Dawley rats

    text: Rats were further subdivided by treatment (cocaine or saline) and exposure
      paradigm (acute or repeated)
  - id: '1_4_8'
    text: This study confirms both the presence of many previously defined cell types
      within the rat NAc, and reveals that D1-MSNs exhibit the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine across all cell populations
  - id: '1_4_9'
    text: Additionally, snRNA-seq of the rat NAc allowed for the investigation of
      cluster-specific expression of different neurotransmitter receptor systems and
      identified novel marker genes for two populations of transcriptionally distinct
      D1-MSNs.
  - id: '2_1_1'
    text: To begin understanding cell-type heterogeneity within the rat NAc, we first
      integrated 15,655 nuclei from a previously published dataset (Savell et al.,
      2020) consisting of male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats that received
      a single (acute) injection of cocaine with 23,599 nuclei from a new dataset
      following seven daily (repeated) injections of cocaine (Fig

      that all clusters were well mixed, indicating successful integration (Supp
  - id: '2_1_12'
    text: A significant portion of neurons within the NAc are GABAergic MSNs that
      express high levels of Gad1, Ppp1r1b,Foxp2,and Bcl11b (Fig
  - id: '2_1_14'
    text: A large majority of MSNs can be further classified by the expression of
      Drd1, the gene encoding the type-1 dopamine receptor, or Drd2, the gene encoding
      the type-2 dopamine receptor (Fig
  - id: '2_1_16'
    text: While we have previously reported the presence of two transcriptionally
      distinct Drd2-expressing MSN populations (Drd2-MSN-1 and Drd2-MSN-2) (Savell
      et al., 2020), this analysis also identified two transcriptionally distinct
      Drd1-expressing MSN populations as well (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig
  - id: '2_1_18'
    text: In addition to Drd1-and Drd2-MSNs, this analysis also identified previously
      reported Drd3-and Grm8-expressing MSNs (Drd3-MSN and Grm8-MSN), which have also
      been identified within the striatum of non-human primates (He et al., 2021)
  - id: '2_1_19'
    text: While most of the GABAergic neurons in the NAc are MSNs, distinct populations
      of GABAergic interneurons are also known to play critical yet distinct roles
      in striatal function (Kawaguchi, 1993)
  - id: '2_1_20'
    text: While we have previously characterized parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons
      within the NAc (Savell et al., 2020), this analysis also identified a cholinergic
      interneuron population marked by the expression of Chat (Chat-Interneuron)
  - id: '2_1_21'
    text: Previous research has demonstrated that Chat-Interneurons are critical regulators
      of drug-induced behavioral adaptations (Witten et al., 2010), and this dataset
      now provides comprehensive transcriptional profiling of these cells within the
      rat NAc
  - id: '2_1_22'
    text: In addition to transcriptionally distinct neuronal populations, we also
      identified 5 glial clusters that are almost entirely devoid of Gad1 and Syt1
      mRNA, and expressed canonical markers of their respective populations (Fig
  - id: '2_1_24'

      Oligodendrocytes exhibit high expression of Mbp, the gene encoding myelin basic
      protein (Fig

    text: The integration of over 39,000 nuclei from rats that underwent different
      cocaine exposure paradigms identified two populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs

  - id: '3_1_3'
    text: To begin understanding the distinct gene expression signatures of these
      Drd1-MSN populations, we conducted a differential expression analysis using
      pseudobulked gene expression matrices
  - id: '3_1_4'
    text: This analysis identified 506 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 cluster and
      665 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 cluster
  - id: '3_1_5'
    text: Interestingly, Ebf1 is the most highly enriched differentially expressed
      gene in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig

    text: Ebf1 is a known marker of D1-MSNs and is implicated in MSN early development
      (Lobo et al., 2008)
  - id: '3_1_8'
    text: Calb1, the gene encoding the calcium binding protein Calbindin 1, is another
      gene that is enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '3_1_10'
    text: Calb1 is a spatial marker within the NAc and is highly enriched in the NAc
      core (Jongen-Rêlo et al., 1994)
  - id: '3_1_11'
    text: Included in the top 10 differentially expressed genes in the Drd1-MSN-2
      population was Htr4, the gene that codes for the serotonin receptor 4 (Fig
  - id: '3_1_13'
    text: HTR4 autoradiography suggests that this receptor is located in the ventral
      portion of the NAc shell (Jean et al., 2012)
  - id: '3_1_14'
    text: The differential enrichment of Htr4 and Calb1 suggests that the two populations
      of Drd1expressing MSNs identified by snRNA-seq are both transcriptionally and
      spatially distinct.
  - id: '3_2_1'
    text: Next, we set out to understand the specific gene networks and pathways that
      may be enriched in these two D1-MSN populations
  - id: '3_2_2'
    text: Molecular function pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of genes involved
      in calcium transport and signaling in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, but enrichment
      of genes involved in potassium transport in the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_4'
    text: For example, Trpc3, a gene encoding a calcium permeable channel, and Cacng3,
      a gene encoding an L-type calcium channel, are both highly enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_6'
    text: Conversely, several genes encoding potassium channels, such as Kcnc1, Kcnc2,
      and Kcng3, are enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 population, further highlighting the
      enrichment of genes involved in potassium transport in this population
  - id: '3_2_7'
    text: While these genes are differentially enriched, both calcium-and potassium-related
      genes are expressed to some extent in both clusters (Fig

      in the mammalian brain requires the use of cell type-specific promoters
  - id: '3_3_2'
    text: To facilitate the future investigation of the two populations of transcriptionally
      distinct Drd1-expressing MSNs, we next identified potential marker genes that
      are both differentially and highly expressed within a population
  - id: '3_3_3'
    text: This analysis identified Ebf1 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_3_4'
    text: 2e) and Htr4 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_3_6'
    text: An additional characteristic of marker genes is that they are expressed
      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster
  - id: '3_3_7'
    text: Plotting the expression of these genes on a UMAP shows differential enrichment
      of Ebf1 and Htr4 between the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Fig
  - id: '3_3_9'
    text: However, Ebf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells, while Htr4 is also
      expressed in Drd2and Drd3-MSNs
  - id: '3_3_10'
    text: Thus, these genes may act as marker genes in combination with Drd1 but cannot
      act as marker genes alone.
  - id: '4_1_1'
    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol
  - id: '4_1_2'
    text: To enable visualization of distinct puncta representing cells expressing
      a combination of Drd1, Htr4, and Ebf1, we performed multiplexed analysis with
      probe sets specific to each transcript (Fig
  - id: '4_1_4'
    text: Consistent with our computational analysis, we identify unique subpopulations
      of Drd1 cells that are either Ebf1 or Htr4, with significantly fewer cells that
      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig
  - id: '4_1_6'
    text: Furthermore, our in situ experiments revealed unique spatial distributions
      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig
  - id: '4_1_8'
    text: There was no significant spatial distribution difference in the proportion
      of Drd1 Ebf1Htr4 cells

      largely non-overlapping expression of Ebf1 and Htr4 within Drd1 cells (Fig

      alters the transcriptome of molecularly defined cell types within the NAc (Savell

    text: Strikingly, the Drd1-MSN-1 population exhibited the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine, with 236 total DEGs following cocaine experience (184 upregulated,

    text: These upregulated DEGs include immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Nr4a3,
      Tiparp, and Fosl2 (Fig

      a key role in the neuronal and behavioral response to dopamine and drugs of

      in Astrocytes following cocaine exposure (Fig

    text: While most DEGs in the Astrocyte population are downregulated with cocaine,
      Pde10a, the gene encoding the cAMPregulated phosphodiesterase 10A, is upregulated
      by cocaine in both the Astrocyte and Sst-Interneuron cluster (Fig

    text: Next, we set out to investigate the relationship of cocaine dependent DEGs
      across cocaine exposure paradigms

      samples with exposure type ignored (i.e., all cocaine samples vs all saline
      samples), acute exposure only, and repeated exposure samples only

    text: The log2 (Fold Change) values for all DEGs were then concatenated and subject
      to hierarchical clustering

      cocaine are also altered by repeated cocaine in the same direction (Fig

      patterns, some cocaine-regulated genes within the Astrocyte cluster demonstrate

      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)

    text: Thus, the identification of a population of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the
      NAc with a significantly attenuated transcriptional response to cocaine is intriguing
      because it highlights a previously underappreciated level of molecular heterogeneity
      within this population of cells

    text: The differential enrichment for calcium-related terms and genes may explain
      the transcriptional response to cocaine in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, as many
      IEGs rely on calcium-dependent signaling cascades for induction.

    text: While a significant amount of research has focused on the role of DA receptor-expressing
      MSNs in adaptations to drugs of abuse, recent reports have also demonstrated
      significant roles for other cell types
  - id: '1_3_3'
    text: For example, optogenetic inhibition of NAc somatostatin expressing interneurons
      (Sst-interneurons) attenuates cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (Ribeiro
      et al., 2018), suggesting that these cells are important for behavioral adaptations
      to drugs of abuse

    text: These results demonstrate that diverse cell types within the NAc contribute
      to the molecular, cellular, and behavioral effects of cocaine.

    text: Despite established cell type heterogeneity in the NAc, many studies rely
      on transgenic animal models that allow for the investigation of these changes
      only in individual cell populations
  - id: '1_4_2'
    text: Unlike many techniques focused on a defined class of cells, single nucleus
      RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution that allows for
      the investigation of thousands of genes in thousands of cells with a single
      assay
  - id: '1_4_3'
    text: This resolution not only permits detection of cocaine-induced transcriptional
      changes in many cell types, but also allows for better understanding of the
      molecular heterogeneity within the NAc

    text: Recently, snRNA-seq approaches have been used to generate cellular atlases
      of the mouse (Chen et al., 2021), non-human primate (He et al., 2021), and human
      (Tran et al., 2021) NAc

    text: However, snRNA-seq has only been used to define early gene expression changes
      to acute cocaine, while the transcriptional effects of repeated cocaine in various
      NAc cell types is less well studied

    text: Rats were further subdivided by treatment (cocaine or saline) and exposure
      paradigm (acute or repeated)
  - id: '1_4_8'
    text: This study confirms both the presence of many previously defined cell types
      within the rat NAc, and reveals that D1-MSNs exhibit the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine across all cell populations
  - id: '1_4_9'
    text: Additionally, snRNA-seq of the rat NAc allowed for the investigation of
      cluster-specific expression of different neurotransmitter receptor systems and
      identified novel marker genes for two populations of transcriptionally distinct
      D1-MSNs.
  - id: '2_1_1'
    text: To begin understanding cell-type heterogeneity within the rat NAc, we first
      integrated 15,655 nuclei from a previously published dataset (Savell et al.,
      2020) consisting of male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats that received
      a single (acute) injection of cocaine with 23,599 nuclei from a new dataset
      following seven daily (repeated) injections of cocaine (Fig

      that all clusters were well mixed, indicating successful integration (Supp
  - id: '2_1_12'
    text: A significant portion of neurons within the NAc are GABAergic MSNs that
      express high levels of Gad1, Ppp1r1b,Foxp2,and Bcl11b (Fig
  - id: '2_1_14'
    text: A large majority of MSNs can be further classified by the expression of
      Drd1, the gene encoding the type-1 dopamine receptor, or Drd2, the gene encoding
      the type-2 dopamine receptor (Fig
  - id: '2_1_16'
    text: While we have previously reported the presence of two transcriptionally
      distinct Drd2-expressing MSN populations (Drd2-MSN-1 and Drd2-MSN-2) (Savell
      et al., 2020), this analysis also identified two transcriptionally distinct
      Drd1-expressing MSN populations as well (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig
  - id: '2_1_18'
    text: In addition to Drd1-and Drd2-MSNs, this analysis also identified previously
      reported Drd3-and Grm8-expressing MSNs (Drd3-MSN and Grm8-MSN), which have also
      been identified within the striatum of non-human primates (He et al., 2021)
  - id: '2_1_19'
    text: While most of the GABAergic neurons in the NAc are MSNs, distinct populations
      of GABAergic interneurons are also known to play critical yet distinct roles
      in striatal function (Kawaguchi, 1993)
  - id: '2_1_20'
    text: While we have previously characterized parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons
      within the NAc (Savell et al., 2020), this analysis also identified a cholinergic
      interneuron population marked by the expression of Chat (Chat-Interneuron)
  - id: '2_1_21'
    text: Previous research has demonstrated that Chat-Interneurons are critical regulators
      of drug-induced behavioral adaptations (Witten et al., 2010), and this dataset
      now provides comprehensive transcriptional profiling of these cells within the
      rat NAc
  - id: '2_1_22'
    text: In addition to transcriptionally distinct neuronal populations, we also
      identified 5 glial clusters that are almost entirely devoid of Gad1 and Syt1
      mRNA, and expressed canonical markers of their respective populations (Fig
  - id: '2_1_24'

      Oligodendrocytes exhibit high expression of Mbp, the gene encoding myelin basic
      protein (Fig

    text: The integration of over 39,000 nuclei from rats that underwent different
      cocaine exposure paradigms identified two populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs
      (Drd1-MSN-1 and Drd1-MSN-2; Fig
  - id: '3_1_3'
    text: To begin understanding the distinct gene expression signatures of these
      Drd1-MSN populations, we conducted a differential expression analysis using
      pseudobulked gene expression matrices
  - id: '3_1_4'
    text: This analysis identified 506 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 cluster and
      665 genes enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 cluster
  - id: '3_1_5'
    text: Interestingly, Ebf1 is the most highly enriched differentially expressed
      gene in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '3_1_8'
    text: Calb1, the gene encoding the calcium binding protein Calbindin 1, is another
      gene that is enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '3_1_10'
    text: Calb1 is a spatial marker within the NAc and is highly enriched in the NAc
      core (Jongen-Rêlo et al., 1994)
  - id: '3_1_11'
    text: Included in the top 10 differentially expressed genes in the Drd1-MSN-2
      population was Htr4, the gene that codes for the serotonin receptor 4 (Fig
  - id: '3_1_13'
    text: HTR4 autoradiography suggests that this receptor is located in the ventral
      portion of the NAc shell (Jean et al., 2012)
  - id: '3_1_14'
    text: The differential enrichment of Htr4 and Calb1 suggests that the two populations
      of Drd1expressing MSNs identified by snRNA-seq are both transcriptionally and
      spatially distinct.
  - id: '3_2_1'
    text: Next, we set out to understand the specific gene networks and pathways that
      may be enriched in these two D1-MSN populations
  - id: '3_2_2'
    text: Molecular function pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of genes involved
      in calcium transport and signaling in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, but enrichment
      of genes involved in potassium transport in the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_4'
    text: For example, Trpc3, a gene encoding a calcium permeable channel, and Cacng3,
      a gene encoding an L-type calcium channel, are both highly enriched in the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_2_6'
    text: Conversely, several genes encoding potassium channels, such as Kcnc1, Kcnc2,
      and Kcng3, are enriched in the Drd1-MSN-2 population, further highlighting the
      enrichment of genes involved in potassium transport in this population

    text: While these genes are differentially enriched, both calcium-and potassium-related
      genes are expressed to some extent in both clusters (Fig

    text: Functional investigation of transcriptionally distinct populations of neurons
      in the mammalian brain requires the use of cell type-specific promoters
  - id: '3_3_2'
    text: To facilitate the future investigation of the two populations of transcriptionally
      distinct Drd1-expressing MSNs, we next identified potential marker genes that
      are both differentially and highly expressed within a population
  - id: '3_3_3'
    text: This analysis identified Ebf1 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-1
      population (Fig
  - id: '3_3_4'
    text: 2e) and Htr4 as a potential marker gene for the Drd1-MSN-2 population (Fig
  - id: '3_3_6'
    text: An additional characteristic of marker genes is that they are expressed
      in a large proportion of cells within the cluster
  - id: '3_3_7'
    text: Plotting the expression of these genes on a UMAP shows differential enrichment
      of Ebf1 and Htr4 between the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Fig
  - id: '3_3_9'
    text: However, Ebf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells, while Htr4 is also
      expressed in Drd2and Drd3-MSNs
  - id: '3_3_10'
    text: Thus, these genes may act as marker genes in combination with Drd1 but cannot
      act as marker genes alone.
  - id: '4_1_1'
    text: To validate snRNA-seq findings demonstrating that Htr4 and Ebf1 are in largely
      distinct populations of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the NAc, we used RNAscope (Wang
      et al., 2012), a previously established fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      protocol
  - id: '4_1_4'
    text: Consistent with our computational analysis, we identify unique subpopulations
      of Drd1 cells that are either Ebf1 or Htr4, with significantly fewer cells that
      are positive for both Ebf1 and Htr4 (Fig
  - id: '4_1_6'
    text: Furthermore, our in situ experiments revealed unique spatial distributions
      for these subpopulations with a significantly higher proportion of Drd1Htr4
      cells in the NAc shell and Drd1Ebf1 cells in the NAc core (Fig
  - id: '4_1_8'
    text: There was no significant spatial distribution difference in the proportion
      of Drd1 Ebf1Htr4 cells
  - id: '4_1_9'
    text: Overall, these results are consistent with snRNA-seq analysis, and confirm
      largely non-overlapping expression of Ebf1 and Htr4 within Drd1 cells (Fig

    text: We previously demonstrated that a single acute cocaine exposure differentially
      alters the transcriptome of molecularly defined cell types within the NAc (Savell
      et al., 2020)
  - id: '5_1_2'
    text: To begin understanding how repeated cocaine exposure alters the transcriptome
      of distinct NAc populations, we injected male and female Sprague-Dawley rats
      with 20 mgkg cocaine for 7 consecutive days (Fig
  - id: '5_1_9'
    text: This approach increased the number of replicates used for statistical comparisons
      and circumvented previously identified issues with deprecated differential expression
      methods previously used for snRNA-seq (Squair et al., 2021)
  - id: '5_1_10'
    text: Strikingly, the Drd1-MSN-1 population exhibited the most robust transcriptional
      response to cocaine, with 236 total DEGs following cocaine experience (184 upregulated,
      52 downregulated; Fig
  - id: '5_1_12'
    text: These upregulated DEGs include immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Nr4a3,
      Tiparp, and Fosl2 (Fig

    text: Recent evidence has demonstrated that astrocytes within the NAc also play
      a key role in the neuronal and behavioral response to dopamine and drugs of
      abuse (Wang et al., 2021;Corkrum et al., 2020;Shelkar et al., 2022)

    text: Disruption of glutamatergic transport, release, and signaling is implicated
      in substance use disorders (Reissner and Kalivas, 2010;Kalivas, 2009), and astrocytes
      are heavily involved in the regulation of this process across the brain (Mahmoud
      et al., 2019)

    text: Unlike the Drd1-MSN-1 population, Astrocytes exhibited more genes with cocaine-dependent
      decreases in expression (Fig
  - id: '5_1_20'
    text: While most DEGs in the Astrocyte population are downregulated with cocaine,
      Pde10a, the gene encoding the cAMPregulated phosphodiesterase 10A, is upregulated
      by cocaine in both the Astrocyte and Sst-Interneuron cluster (Fig
  - id: '5_2_2'
    text: More specifically, snRNA-seq from the rat NAc following acute cocaine exposure
      demonstrated that D1-MSNs have the most robust transcriptional response to cocaine
      when compared to other transcriptionally distinct NAc cell types (Savell et
      al., 2020)

    text: In this dataset, only one of the Drd1-expressing MSN populations (Drd1-MSN-1)
      had a robust transcriptional response to cocaine

    text: For example, Nr4a3, Fosb, Fosl2, and Tiparp are all significantly increased
      following cocaine exposure only in the Drd1-MSN-1 population (Fig
  - id: '5_3_1'
    text: Next, we set out to investigate the relationship of cocaine dependent DEGs
      across cocaine exposure paradigms
  - id: '5_3_3'
    text: The log2 (Fold Change) values for all DEGs were then concatenated and subject
      to hierarchical clustering
  - id: '5_3_4'
    text: Overall, this analysis identified that many of the genes altered by acute
      cocaine are also altered by repeated cocaine in the same direction (Fig
  - id: '5_3_6'
    text: However, for the Drd1-MSN-1 population some genes altered by acute cocaine
      are not altered by repeated cocaine
  - id: '5_3_7'
    text: Furthermore, while the overall pattern shows concordant gene expression
      patterns, some cocaine-regulated genes within the Astrocyte cluster demonstrate
      opposite changes with an acute or repeated exposure
  - id: '5_3_8'
    text: To estimate the degree of concordance between gene expression programs altered
      by acute and repeated cocaine exposure in a thresholdfree manner, we next used
      the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) algorithm (Cahill et al., 2018)
  - id: '5_3_9'
    text: To complete this analysis, we ranked gene lists by the log2 (Fold Change),
      which was calculated by dividing the log-normalized expression values of cocaine
      cells by the log-normalized expression values of saline cells
  - id: '5_3_11'
    text: For example, the acute and repeated cocaine changes for the Drd1-MSN-1,
      Astrocyte, and Sst-Interneuron populations are significantly concordant for
      both upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig

      for these populations.

    text: Recently, transcriptional atlases of the non-human primate (NHP) striatum
      (He et al., 2021) and human NAc (Tran et al., 2021) have demonstrated similar
      gene expression profiles of specific marker genes that we identify within the
      rat NAc
  - id: '6_1_2'
    text: To quantify this overlap and perform cross-species comparisons, we focused
      on conservation of MSNs given that both NHP and human datasets identified and
      validated the presence of several transcriptionally distinct MSN subtypes
  - id: '6_1_5'
    text: For example, the rat Drd1-MSN-1 population is correlated with the human
      D1.MSN_A and NHP D1.Matrix populations, and the rat Drd2-MSN-1 population is
      correlated with the human D2.MSN_A and the NHP D2

    text: For example, Drd2-MSNs are classically characterized by the enrichment of
      Drd2 and Penk, while Drd1-MSNs are characterized by the enrichment of Drd1 and
      Ebf1

    text: Across species, transcriptionally distinct populations of Drd2-MSNs are
      similarly enriched for Drd2, but differ in their enrichment of Penk (Fig

    text: While the differential expression of Htr4 or Ebf1 distinguishes Drd1-MSNs
      in the rat NAc, this pattern is not observed in higher order mammals as Htr4
      is ubiquitously expressed across cell types (Supp

      the size of our previously published work

    text: The addition of both biological and technical replicates, along with the
      addition of over 24,000 nuclei, allowed us to generate a comprehensive transcriptional
      atlas of the rat NAc and investigate cell type-specific transcriptional responses
      to cocaine.

      occurring in the VTA across several cocaine paradigms and identified several
      IEGs that are upregulated by experimenter-administered cocaine injections (Campbell

    text: The second population of Drd1-expressing MSNs within the NAc, Drd1-MSN-2,
      did not have a robust transcriptional response to cocaine experience

    text: Thus, the identification of a population of Drd1-expressing MSNs in the
      NAc with a significantly attenuated transcriptional response to cocaine is intriguing
      because it highlights a previously underappreciated level of molecular heterogeneity
      within this population of cells

      of calcium transport-related terms for Drd1-MSN-1 and potassium transport-related
      terms for Drd1-MSN-2

    text: The differential enrichment for calcium-related terms and genes may explain
      the transcriptional response to cocaine in the Drd1-MSN-1 population, as many
      IEGs rely on calcium-dependent signaling cascades for induction.
